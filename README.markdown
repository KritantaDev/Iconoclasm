# Iconoclasm

*Iconoclasm* is a tweak that lets you do more with your iPhone's home screen. It was sold on the Cydia Store from 2009 to 2015, and now it is open source for others who wish to use its code in their own similar products. Please read [this page][eol] for more details on what's going on with the project.

## Building Iconoclasm

*Iconoclasm* predates Theos, which is probably the most commonly used build system in the jailbreak community today. For a variety of reasons, I rolled my own build script with *waf*, which you will need installed if you want to run the build scripts. I usually just this line in the root of my repo:

```waf distclean configure build_armv7 build_arm64 lipo package -p```

You will almost definitely need to tweak the waf file to point to the SDK you wish to use and your library/header paths, because this build script was never designed with any user other than myself in mind.

## This Is A Huge Mess

This code hasn't aged very well. I wouldn't recommend building off of the Iconoclasm project as a base, but rather using components of the Iconoclasm code or ideas within it to achieve similar or identical results in a different code base.

If you need some help understanding responsibilities in the code so you can make your way around easily:

* Layout classes (ICGridLayout, ICFreeformLayout) act as a pluggable module that encompass most of the logic for reading the right layout out of a plist, converting that into something SpringBoard can deal with, and passing raw coordinates into aâ€¦
* Scaling engine, which exists for each supported screen size, and handles upscaling to other screen sizes as a special case. Things like icon size and aspect ratio can make the scaling results look really weird (see: folder layouts), but in most cases, I still try to fiddle with the coordinates to make them look better.
